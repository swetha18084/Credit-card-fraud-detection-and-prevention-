# AI-Powered Credit Card Fraud Detection and Prevention System

## Overview

This project focuses on developing an AI-powered credit fraud detection and prevention system. The goal is to identify suspicious transactions in real-time, prevent fraudulent activities, and minimize false positives while adapting to evolving threats. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms, anomaly detection techniques, and real-time data analysis to reduce credit fraud losses, improve detection accuracy, and enhance customer experience.

## Problem Statement

The increasing sophistication of credit card fraud necessitates advanced detection and prevention mechanisms. This project aims to address this challenge by developing an AI-powered system capable of:

* Identifying suspicious transactions in real-time.
* Preventing fraudulent activities effectively.
* Minimizing the occurrence of false positives.
* Adapting to new and evolving fraud tactics.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this model building project are:

* To develop an accurate machine learning model for real-time credit fraud detection and prevention.
* To minimize false positives in fraud detection.
* To ensure the interpretability of the developed model.
* To optimize the model's performance for handling large transaction volumes.
